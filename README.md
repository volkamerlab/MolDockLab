# MolDockLab Workflow

MolDockLab is a **data-driven workflow** designed to identify the best balanced consensus **Structure-Based Virtual Screening (SBVS)** workflow for a tet of interest. The workflow integrates various **docking tools**, **scoring functions**, and **consensus methods** to achieve optimal screening performance.

As a validation case study, the workflow was applied to the **EGFR tet** (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) to compare different SBVS pipelines and assess their relative performance. Results can be found in `egfr_data/`.

MolDockLab was used in a real case study to find potential hits for an antibacterial tet called **Energy Coupling Factor (ECF) Transporters**, in a collaboration work with Helmholtz-Institut f√ºr Pharmazeutische Forschung Saarland (HIPS). By screening the in-house library of around 6.6K compounds, it resulted in the identification of **two new antibacterial classes** for the tet, which were validated experimentally.

## Repository Structure

- **`egfr_data/`**: Contains the EGFR-specific data used in the MolDockLab workflow, along with the results generated from running the pipeline.
- **`src/`**: The source code directory containing the core implementation of the MolDockLab workflow.
- **`test_data/`**: A small subset of test data (3 compounds for pipeline selection and 10 compounds for SBVS) used to test the workflow on a smaller scale.
- **`test_output/`**: Output generated from running the workflow on the test data.
- **`EGFR_pipeline.ipynb`**: A Jupyter notebook that reproduces the EGFR tet results. Use this to follow along with the pipeline's analysis for EGFR.
- **`moldocklab.py`**: The main script that orchestrates the execution of the MolDockLab workflow.
- **`setup_py310.sh`**: Installation script to set up the Python 3.10 environment and dependencies required to run the workflow.

## Usage

### Running the Workflow

To execute the workflow, run the `moldocklab.py` script with your desired parameters. Make sure your input data is ready. You can also use the provided test data in `test_data/` for smaller-scale testing. For reproducibility, the following command can be used with the test data:

```
python moldocklab.py --protein_path test_data/5UG9_noligand_protoss.pdb --ref_ligand_path test_data/ref_ligand.pdb --known_ligands_path test_data/test_three_cpds.sdf --sbvs_ligands_path test_data/test_library_10_cpds.sdf --out_dir test_output --true_value_col true_value --docking_programs gnina smina diffdock plants --pose_quality_checker True 
```
For step-by-step tutorial, the steps in `test_run.ipynb` can be followed.
